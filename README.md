# Quantification of lower limb kinematics during swimming in individuals with spinal cord injury

🎯 Objectives: The aim of this project is to apply unsupervised video summarization algorithms to egocentric, home-based videos recorded by individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) and evaluate their performance.

## Summary 

🔍 Authors: Melina Giagiozis, José Zariffa

📝 Summary: Wearable cameras provide a means to assess hand function in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) beyond clinical settings. Previous studies have found that clinicians acknowledge the potential of egocentric video for monitoring and informing rehabilitation, however, the large volumes of video data poses a challenge for its efficient integration into clinical practice. To address this, we implemented and evaluated three video summarization algorithms.
